The goal of this project is to build a Single-Page Application that enables users to search for their favorite artists and find information about albums released by these artists.

This application uses the Spotify API to gather information about artists. Therefore, you need to log into your Spotify account before you can use the app.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
